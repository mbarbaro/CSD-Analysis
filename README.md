# CSD-Analysis

The initial goal of this project is to create a matlab program that can import and graphically display electrocorticography (ECoG) data.

This data will then be analyzed and filtered with the help of Chronux.

Eventually, we would like to look for evidence of cortical spreading depression (CSD) in relation to seizure foci. 

This program should be modifiable to allow for unique patients and ECoG layouts.
